import lists_utils

# when you run this file in the terminal, no functions will be invoked
    # REASON -- file was imported as a module
    
# however, you can now use the functions within the document, much like how you used the 
    # math module, random module, etc
    
# EXAMPLE

my_list = [23, 21, 2, 5, 72]

print(lists_utils.sum_elements(my_list))
    # you are now using a function with the 'lists_utils' doc
        # execute it using the terminal
        
            # instead of a blank output, we get 123
